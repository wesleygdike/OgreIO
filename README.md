Things TO-DO
Client.js
    Handle rendering - Looks like I should have a rendering function for each object type... unless I am using images...

index.js
    Start building out game logic - I feel like the game logic should be in its own file. not stuffed in with the werver startup junk.

General
    Find out how to implement the canvas. I think I had trouble with that last time.
    Build click to move
    Build out selecting objects
    Start defining objects
